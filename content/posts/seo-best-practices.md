Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is crucial for making your website discoverable. Here are some best practices to improve your site's SEO.

## On-Page SEO

### Title Tags and Meta Descriptions

Every page should have a unique, descriptive title tag and meta description:

```html
<title>Your Page Title - Your Site Name</title>
<meta name="description" content="A compelling description of your page content.">
```

### Heading Structure

Use proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3) to structure your content logically. Search engines use headings to understand your content.

## Technical SEO

### Site Speed

Page load speed is a ranking factor. Optimize images, minify CSS and JavaScript, and use a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

### Mobile Responsiveness

Ensure your site is mobile-friendly. Google uses mobile-first indexing, so mobile optimization is essential.

### Structured Data

Use schema.org markup to help search engines understand your content:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Your Article Title",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Your Name"
  }
}
```

## Content Quality

- Write original, valuable content
- Use relevant keywords naturally
- Create internal links between related pages
- Update content regularly

## Conclusion

SEO is an ongoing process. Focus on creating quality content, optimizing technical aspects, and building a great user experience.
